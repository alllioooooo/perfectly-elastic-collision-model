# Perfectly elastic collision model

### Task:

##### Perform a numerical simulation of the perfectly elastic collision between two objects of different masses. 
An object with mass `m2`, moving with velocity `v0`, collides with a stationary object of mass `m1`, where `m1<m2`. Determine how many collisions `N` the object with mass `m1` will have with the left wall and the object with mass `m2` before coming to a complete stop. Assume that collisions with the wall and between the objects are perfectly elastic.

Consider cases where `m2 = m1 * 10^n`, where `n = 1, 2, 3, 4, ...`. Analyze the obtained results.
